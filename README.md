### Sponsored by [Teehee Dental Works](https://teehee.sg/)

**2024HighStakesCode** was designed with portability in mind - we understand that situations can quickly change at any competition.  

Our code is hot-swappable, making heavy use of **abstract classes** and **templates**
to allow for us to rapidly change and test different pieces of code when time is of the essence.

Additionally, our code features a [**custom built CI/CD testing suite via GitHub Actions.**](https://github.com/helloworld3200/1408Hyper-2024VRC-Code/actions/workflows/c-cpp.yml) - the only purpose-made one that exists in the entire world at the time of writing.
