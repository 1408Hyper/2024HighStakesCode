### Sponsored by [Teehee Dental Works](https://teehee.sg/)

**1408Hyper-2024VRC-Code** was designed with portability in mind - we understand that situations can quickly change at any competition.  

Our code is hot-swappable, making heavy use of **abstract classes** and **templates**
to allow for us to rapidly change and test different pieces of code when time is of the essence.

## Included Libraries
- Created with [`PROS` API](https://github.com/purduesigbots/pros)
as this has better documentation.

#### Main file at `src/main.cpp`. To run Make, first install [ARM G++](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).
